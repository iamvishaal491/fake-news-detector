# fake-news-detector
my first ever project that i built for a hackathon...

pretty much its straight forward:
#1 download the source code or copy-paste in the IDEs of your choice
#2 download True and fake news dataset from kaggle | [link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset]
#3 after downloading, have both the true and fake news csv in the same folder as the source code in the IDE
#4 in the 58th line, give a sample news that you want to check
#5 run the program ...and that it!

Note:
the dataset that i have used here is very old (its the news from the year 2017), so the prediction might be bad, even though we get a high accuracy score. So try to create a new dataset with latest news or search in the internet.

Thank you! if u found this useful in someway
